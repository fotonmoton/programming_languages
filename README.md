# Programming Languages
my solutions to ["Programming Languages"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages) course by Dan Grossman. 

Course consists of three separate parts in which author tries to explain language concepts / paradigms through different languages:
- SML
- Raket
- Ruby

Each part has exercises for specific language. You can find this exercies and my solutions in repo.
